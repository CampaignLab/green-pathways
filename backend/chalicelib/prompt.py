Subject: Submission to DWP Consultation: Pathways to Work – Personal Experience and Recommendations
Dear Sir/Madam,
I am writing to submit my experience and views in response to the Department for Work and Pensions' consultation on the "Pathways to Work" green paper.
I have experienced significant challenges navigating the welfare system, particularly with Universal Credit. The process of claiming benefits was extremely distressing and confusing, exacerbated by difficulties in communication with DWP staff. I found the digital system overwhelming, lacking adequate support for those who, like myself, struggle with digital literacy or mental health difficulties.
The delays in processing my claim left me without financial support for weeks, pushing me into significant hardship. This not only affected my mental health but also impacted my ability to secure stable employment, as the stress and uncertainty made it difficult to focus on job searching and attending interviews.
Recommendations:
Simplify the digital claim process and ensure robust, accessible support for claimants unfamiliar or uncomfortable with online systems.
Improve staff training to provide empathetic, clear, and consistent communication with claimants.
Shorten processing times for claims and provide interim financial support to prevent hardship during processing periods.
The current system has potential, but significant improvements in accessibility, empathy, and responsiveness are essential to truly support people back into sustainable employment.
Thank you for considering my views and experiences in your review.
Yours sincerely,
[Name Withheld]
Emotion Summary: The speaker appeared distressed and frustrated, particularly highlighting the impact of the system's complexity and delayed benefit payments on their mental health and financial stability.

Subject: Urgent Concern: Impact of Recent Benefit Changes on My Life
Dear [MP's Name],
I'm reaching out to you because the recent changes to benefits have severely impacted my life, and I feel it's vital that you understand the true consequences these decisions have on people like me.
I rely on these benefits not by choice but out of necessity. In the voice message I recorded, I shared: "Since they changed the benefits, I'm struggling every day to keep my head above water. My anxiety is through the roof—I don't even know how I'll pay my next bill or buy groceries."
This isn't about politics for me; it's about survival. The system was already difficult, but now it feels impossible. As I said in my message, "I feel forgotten, invisible, like my dignity doesn't matter." It's deeply distressing to live with this uncertainty, never knowing if I'll have enough to meet even basic needs.
I implore you to advocate for reversing or amending these changes. Please remember that your decisions directly affect real people—people who just want to live with dignity and stability.
Thank you for taking the time to understand my situation.
Respectfully,
A concerned constituent
