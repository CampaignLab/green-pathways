              A Green Paper is a preliminary government report of proposals that is published to 
              stimulate discussion. It is part of a consultation process that gives people a chance 
              to give feedback before policies are finalized.

            As disabled individuals who are both working, we understand firsthand the challenges within the system. 
            Having experienced the difficulties in accessing support, particularly since childhood, we recognized 
            the need for change. Our understanding of political processes led us to identify Green Papers as a 
            crucial point of intervention.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-600 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
            We created this platform to provide a constructive way to engage with the system and enable others 
            to do the same. We believe that by making the consultation process more accessible, we can increase 
            participation and reduce the potential negative impact of this bill on people's lives.
